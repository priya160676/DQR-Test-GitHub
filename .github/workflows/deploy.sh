#!/bin/bash
# Example deployment script

# Set environment variables if needed
export DEPLOY_ENV="production"
export APP_DIR="/path/to/your/app"

# Log deployment start time
echo "Starting deployment at $(date)" 

# Step 1: Pull the latest changes from the repository (if needed)
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Build the application (this is an example for a Node.js app)
echo "Building the application..."
npm install
npm run build

# Step 3: Deploy the application (this could vary depending on your stack)
# For example, pushing the built code to a server or container registry
echo "Deploying to production..."

# Example: If you're deploying to a server
scp -r ./dist/* user@yourserver:/path/to/deployment/folder

# Or, if you're deploying with Docker
# docker build -t your-app:latest .
# docker run -d --rm --name your-app-container -p 8080:80 your-app:latest

# Step 4: Run tests or checks (optional but recommended)
echo "Running post-deployment tests..."
./test.sh  # Run tests to verify if the deployment was successful

# Step 5: Check deployment status (e.g., check for the app's health or success)
if curl --silent --fail http://your-server/healthcheck; then
    echo "Deployment successful!"
    exit 0  # Exit with success code if deployment is successful
else
    echo "Deployment failed during health check."
    exit 1  # Exit with failure code if health check fails
fi
